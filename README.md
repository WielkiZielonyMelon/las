"Lords and Serfs" is a game were you take the role of a feudal ruler. Your task
is to grow expand your land... while not starving your people.

You can expand your land by buying using grain. But you also need it to feed
your serfs and for sewing, so you can later reap harvest.

20 years should be enough to prove your worth. It might not be easy as you need
to fight famine and rats that eat your grain along the way.
